#wsgi (WEB SERVER GATEWAY INTERFACE)

** gunicorn  **

- standard interface between web server software and PYTHON web applications
- having a standard interface make it wasy to use an  application that supports WSGI with a number of different web servers.

- When client comes --> make a http request to server --> take that request and make that object to a python object (for e.g., Json) called by the framework 

- WSGI standards exists so that you can --> compare any wsgi server --> with any wsgi framework (flask with unicorn)


HOW?
- when we cast a request, the request will convert into python objects. 
- Client http request 

#JSONEncoder
- json exposese an API familiar to user of standard library marshal modules

# Logging (Logging api)

- means of tracking events 
- that happen when some software runs.

- dev adds logging calls to their code to indicate that certain events have occured.

-This is a module define functions and classes 
- which implement a flexible event logging system for application and libraries.

## Benefit of having the logging API:

*********************
- these are logging levels

DEBUG --> detailed information, when diagnosing problems

INFO --> confirmation that things are working as expected.

Psql and PGAdmin
****************
- psql is a command line tool that coems with PostgesSQL
- allow user to interacr with database through a command line interface
- used for task such as creating and managing database objects, running queries, and performing
