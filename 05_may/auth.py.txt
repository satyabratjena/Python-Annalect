***************************************

The decorator dataclass called authinfo.
- to process defining a  class and initializing its attribute providing __init__, __repr__

Authinfo class has 5 attributes defines as class variables

__post_init__ is called called automatically after the object is initialized.
post init method calls the get_profile method to retrieve the user profile information suing SSO(Single sign on) api.

if get_profile method returns true, that indicate the user profile information was successfully retrived, then process_prifle method is called which contains the user's profile information in JSON format, which is obtained from an SSO api

- the method loops through the projects attribute of user profile and checks if the type_key match the value of SSO_PROJ_NAME. this shows if the user has access to correct project.

if type_key not match, it comes to next project
